EventMap
========
EventMap is an application that Aloke Desai, Hong Suh, Mauricio Molina, and I worked on at the Claremont College hackathon
in November of 2012. It uses the google web tool kit package, and only the relevant code (the java classes) are on this
repo for reference (cloning this repository will not result in a workign application).
Users can click the map to create events that will be saved to an external database for college viewing, attempting to
bring event planning to a more dynamic and physical angle.
